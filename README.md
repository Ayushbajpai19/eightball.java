Magic 8-Ball
Overview
This project is slightly different than others you have encountered thus far on Codecademy.
Instead of a step-by-step tutorial, this project contains a series of open-ended requirements
which describe the project you’ll be building. There are many possible ways to correctly fulfill
all of these requirements, and you should expect to use the internet, Codecademy,
and other resources when you encounter a problem that you cannot easily solve.

Project Goals
The Magic 8-Ball is a super popular toy used for fortune-telling or seeking advice, developed in the 1950s!

Write a Magic8.java program that will output a random fortune each time it executes.
